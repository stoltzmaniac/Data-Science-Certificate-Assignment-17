Join `weather` and `airports` (will need some intermediate steps)  

```{r}
weather_airports <- ...
```


From the `weather_airports` data you created (via joining tables). Find the average `distance` the `carrier` `UA` flies whose `origin` is `JFK`
```{r}

```


Similar to the previous statement, calculate the average `distance` of each `carrier` whose `origin` is `JFK` and display them from highest to lowest.
```{r}

```

Display a plot of the top 5 `carrier` that flew the greatest overall distance in March of 2013, result should show `carrier` as well as `total_distance`
```{r}

```


Which `planes` `model` was the most common in `year` 2004?
```{r}

```

Show a histogram with 20 bins of the `hour` from `flights`.
```{r}

```


Make a scatter plot of average `day` `average_distance` from `flights` with the x-axis as `carrier` `UA` and y-axis as `carrier` `AA`
```{r}

```


Create a linear model between `dep_delay` and `arr_delay` where `arr_delay` is the target variable.
```{r}

```

To the lay person, describe what the coefficients from your model mean?

<Write your answer here>


Assume all data is already cleaned. From the `planes` table, using `year`, `engine`, and `seats` - build a model to predict `manufacturer` (filtered for you). Describe your model and interpret your results.
```{r}
clean_data <- planes %>% 
  filter(manufacturer %in% c('BOEING', 'AIRBUS INDUSTRIE', 'BOMBARDIER INC', 'AIRBUS', 'EMBRAER')) %>%
  ...
```
